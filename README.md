# UNESCO_Site_Tracker
A program which enables one to keep track of, and map, all the UNESCO World Heritage sites which they have visited in the world.
Uses pandas and geopandas to map points by latitude and longtitude, which are then colour-coordinated to show if one has visited
them. Black represents a site has been visited, red represents it has not been visited.
